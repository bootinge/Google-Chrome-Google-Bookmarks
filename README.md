#Google Chrome - Simple Google Bookmarks Sync

Chrome extension that syncs bookmarks from Google Bookmarks into one Chrome bookmarks folder. 
It can be used one-time only for importing Google Bookmarks or as an extension to sync them periodically.
Simple.

**Features**

Import Google Bookmarks into Chrome Google bookmarks folder.
Sync bookmarks periodically.

This is not a Google extension. I am not affiliated in any way with Google. The extension in only using the Google Bookmarks excel export and Chrome Bookmarks API.
